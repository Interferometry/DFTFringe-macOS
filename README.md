DFTFringe 6.3.1 for macOS

What's Changed

- Fixed some issues with regions that caused DFTF to crash if you didn't check them each time\
- Regions are remembered better from one igram to the next
- Fixed a few minor bugs related to "edge mask":
    null calculation when first opening DFTF
    saving edge mask
    improved an edge mask message wording
- Improved many things that only affect DFTFringe programming team
- New windows installer
- Linux version of DFTF now exists (only for latest ubuntu) and is always built automatically
